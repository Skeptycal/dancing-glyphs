This is work-in-progress. Plase note:

* Currently there is no configuration sheet, all configuration must be done in `Configuration.swift`

* Dark mode is currently broken

* Rendering is CPU intensive, despite hardware acceleration. Better don't use this on battery power.

* Frame rate is always displayed in the bottom left corner for now.
